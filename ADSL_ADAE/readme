The focus of this program is generating a report for user-selected adverse events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term, based on mock ADSL and ADAE datasets. 
My goal was to create the program using only SAS, without PROC SQL.
To change the desired reported adverse events, only adding or removing elements from aelist on line 2 of the code is needed
